# primeChecker

This code defines a function called prime_checker. The function takes one argument, n, which is the number to check for primality. The function first sets a variable called is_prime to True. This variable will be used to track whether or not n is a prime number.

The next part of the function is a loop that iterates from 2 to n-1. For each number in the loop, the function checks if n is divisible by that number. If n is divisible by any of the numbers in the loop, then is_prime is set to False.

After the loop, the function checks the value of is_prime. If is_prime is True, then the function prints a message that says n is a prime number. Otherwise, the function prints a message that says n is not a prime number.

The last part of the code is a call to the prime_checker function. The function is called with the input from the user as its argument. The output of the function will be a message that says whether or not the number entered by the user is a prime number.
